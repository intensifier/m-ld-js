## Transactions
<!-- Note this section is duplicated from the Pattern type in src/jrql-support.ts -->
A m-ld transaction is a **json-rql** pattern, which represents a data read or a
data write. See the **m-ld**
[specification](https://spec.m-ld.org/#transactions) for a walk-through of the syntax.

Supported pattern types for this engine are (follow the links for examples):
- [Describe](/interfaces/describe.html)
- [Select](/interfaces/select.html)
- [Construct](/interfaces/construct.html)
- [Group](/interfaces/group.html) or [Subject](/interfaces/subject.html) (the shorthand way to insert data)
- [Update](/interfaces/update.html) (the longhand way to insert or delete data)

> ðŸ’¡ *If you have a requirement for an unsupported pattern, please

> browse the full **json-rql** syntax at
