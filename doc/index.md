# **m-ld** Javascript clone engine

The Javascript engine can be used in a modern browser or a server engine like
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

> The Javascript clone engine conforms to the **m-ld**
> [specification](http://spec.m-ld.org/). Its support for transaction pattern
> complexity is detailed [below](#transactions). Its [concurrency](#concurrency)
> model is based on immutable states.

## Getting Started

`npm install @m-ld/m-ld`

There are two starter projects available:

- The [Node.js&nbsp;project](https://github.com/m-ld/m-ld-nodejs-starter)
  uses Node processes to initialise two clones, and an MQTT broker for
  messaging.
- The [Web&nbsp;project](https://github.com/m-ld/m-ld-web-starter) shows one way
  to build a multi-collaborator forms application for browsers, using Socket.io
  for messaging.

### Data Persistence

**m-ld** uses [abstract-level](https://github.com/Level/abstract-level) to interface with a
LevelDB-compatible storage backend.

- For the fastest in-memory responses, use [memory-level](https://github.com/Level/memory-level).
- In a service or native application, use [classic-level](https://github.com/Level/classic-level) (file system storage).
- In a browser, you can use [browser-level](https://github.com/Level/browser-level) (browser-local storage).

### Connecting to Other Clones

A **m-ld** clone uses a 'remotes' object to communicate with other clones.

- With an MQTT broker, use [`MqttRemotes`](#mqtt-remotes).
- For a scalable global managed service, use [`AblyRemotes`](#ably-remotes).
- If you have a live web server (not just CDN or serverless), you can use
  [`IoRemotes`](#socketio-remotes).

> ðŸš§ *If your architecture includes some other publish/subscribe service like AMQP or Apache Kafka, or you would like to use a fully peer-to-peer protocol, please [contact&nbsp;us](https://m-ld.org/hello/) to discuss your use-case. Remotes can even utilise multiple transport protocols, for example WebRTC with a suitable signalling service.*

### Initialisation

The [clone](#clone) function initialises the m-ld engine with a leveldb back-end
and the clone [configuration](interfaces/meldconfig.html).

```typescript
import { clone, uuid } from '@m-ld/m-ld';
import { MemoryLevel } from 'memory-level';
import { MqttRemotes, MeldMqttConfig } from '@m-ld/m-ld/ext/mqtt';

const config: MeldMqttConfig = {
  '@id': uuid(),
  '@domain': 'test.example.org',
  genesis: true,
  mqtt: { hostname: 'mqtt.example.org' }
};

const meld = await clone(new MemoryLevel, MqttRemotes, config);
```

The `clone` function returns control as soon as it is safe to start making data
transactions against the domain. If this clone has has been re-started from
persisted state, it may still be receiving updates from the domain. This can
cause a UI to start showing these updates. If instead, you want to wait until
the clone has the most recent data, you can add:

```typescript
await meld.status.becomes({ online: true, outdated: false });
```
