/**
 * The experimental Object-Resource Mapping (ORM) layer is a set of constructs
 * to support idiomatic use of object-oriented Javascript with the core **m-ld**
 * API. Instead of programming with reads and writes to the domain graph, you
 * manipulate Javascript objects that reflect the domain.
 *
 * > ðŸ§ª ORM is currently used internally in extensions and has not yet been
 * tested in an application. If it sounds just like what you're looking to do
 * in your application, please [let us know](https://m-ld.org/hello)!
 *
 * An ORM domain object is a top-level container for a mutable graph of
 * {@link OrmSubject "subjects"} in-memory, where subjects are instances of
 * Javascript classes, and graph edges are straightforward class properties.
 *
 * Since read operations like traversal of graph edges are asynchronous in
 * **m-ld**, an ORM domain can be in an "updating" state, in which some edge may
 * not be fully loaded (sometimes called a "fault"). This mode is entered using
 * the {@link updating} method. It gives access to an {@link OrmUpdating} state,
 * from which graph content can be loaded. An updating state is required to
 * create new subject instances attached to the domain object (also since their
 * properties may need loading).
 *
 * Mutations of the graph by the app MUST NOT be done in an updating state (a
 * subject property that is not yet loaded could have an unexpected value of
 * `undefined` or `empty`; and the app mutation may be overridden by an
 * asynchronous load). An exception to this is setting the initial properties
 * of a new subject. Changes to a subject, or to the whole ORM domain, can be
 * {@link commit committed} to a writeable **m-ld** state.
 *
 * @see {@link OrmSubject}
 * @experimental
 * @category Experimental
