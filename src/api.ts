 * Extensions can then be installed in two ways:
 * 1. By providing the implementation in the `app` parameter of the [clone

 * 2. By declaring a module in the domain information.
 *
 * The first option is suitable when the data is always going to be used by the
 * same app â€“ because the app will always know it has to include the extension.
 *
 * The second option is more suitable if the data may be shared to other apps,
 * because the need for the extension is declared in the data itself, and apps
 * can load it dynamically as required.
 *
 * To write an extension to be declared in the domain data, implement
 * MeldExtensions with one or more of its methods, in a Javascript class. Then,
 * to declare the extension in the domain, you write:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "@id": "http://m-ld.org/extensions",
 *   "@list": {
 *     "â‰ªpriorityâ‰«": {
 *       "@id": "â‰ªyour-extension-iriâ‰«",

 *       "http://js.m-ld.org/#class": "â‰ªyour-extension-class-nameâ‰«"
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Breaking this down:
 *
 * - `"http://m-ld.org/extensions"` is the identity of the extensions list. This
 * is a constant that **m-ld** knows about (it's in the `m-ld.org` domain).
 * - The extensions list is declared as a [List](https://spec.m-ld.org/#lists),
 * with the `@list` keyword, because extensions are ordered by priority.
 * - The value you give for `â‰ªpriorityâ‰«` (a number) will determine where in the
 * list your extension appears. The highest priority is `"0"`. The value is
 * decided by you, based on what you know about your extensions. In most cases
 * it won't matter, since extensions shouldn't interfere with each other.
 * - The `"http://js.m-ld.org/#require"` and `"http://js.m-ld.org/#class"`
 * properties tell the module loader how to instantiate your module class. It
 * will call a global `require` function with the first, dereference the second
 * and call `new` on it.
 *
 * Most extensions will provide a static convenience function to generate this
 * JSON, which can be called in the genesis clone

 * reference some immutable data such as specific block in a blockchain, or an
 * append-only table row.
