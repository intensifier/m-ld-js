/**
 * A transport security interceptor extension. Modifies data buffers sent to

 * Installed transport security can be independent of the actual remoting
 * protocol, and therefore contribute to layered security.
 *
 * Wire security can be required for bootstrap messages during clone
 * initialisation, i.e. `type` is `http://control.m-ld.org/request/clock` or
 * `http://control.m-ld.org/request/snapshot` (and no prior state exists). In
 * that case the `state` parameter of the methods will be `null`.
