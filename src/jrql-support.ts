   * Subjects with properties to be inserted into the domain. Variables may be used, values for
   * which will be established as follows:
   * - If a `@where` clause exists, then values matched in the `@where` clause will be used.
   * - If there is no `@where`, but a `@delete` clause exists, then values matched in the
   * `@delete` clause will be used.
   * - If a variable value is not matched by the `@where` or `@delete` clause as above, no
   * insertion
   * happens (i.e. there must exist a _complete_ solution to all variables in the `@insert`).
   *
   * **Note** that in the case that the `@insert` contains no variables, there is a difference
   * between matching with a `@where` and `@delete`. If a `@where` clause is provided, it _must_
   * match some existing data for the inserts to happen. However, if no `@where` clauses is
   * provided, then the insertion will happen even if nothing is matched by the `@delete`.
   *
   * For example, assume this data exists:
   * ```json
   * { "@id": "fred", "name": "Fred" }
   * ```
   *
   * Compare the following update patterns:
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "@delete": { "@id": "fred", "height": "?height" },
   *   "@insert": { "@id": "fred", "height": "6" }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The pattern above updates Fred's height to 6, even though no prior height value exists.
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "@delete": { "@id": "fred", "height": "?height" },
   *   "@insert": { "@id": "fred", "height": "6" },
   *   "@where": { "@id": "fred", "height": "?height" }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The pattern above does nothing, because no prior height value is matched by the `@where`.
